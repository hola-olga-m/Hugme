echo "üîé Using the @live directive, clients can receive automatic updates without subscriptions."
echo "üí° Key benefits:"
echo "   - Simpler client code (just add @live to your queries)"
echo "   - Automatic updates when data changes"
echo "   - No need to manually manage subscriptions"
echo "   - Works with existing query code"
echo "   - Supports both HTTP and WebSocket interfaces"
echo ""
echo "üìò How to use in your client application:"
echo "  1. HTTP Approach (for simpler clients):"
echo "     POST to /live-query endpoint with query containing @live directive"
echo "     Set up a polling mechanism in your client to re-fetch periodically"
echo ""
echo "  2. WebSocket Approach (for real-time applications):"
echo "     Connect to ws://localhost:5007/graphql"
echo "     Initialize connection with connection_init message"
echo "     Send start message with query containing @live directive"
echo "     Receive updates automatically when data changes"
