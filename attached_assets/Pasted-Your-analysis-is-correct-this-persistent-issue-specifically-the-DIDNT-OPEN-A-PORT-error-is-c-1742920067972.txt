Your analysis is correct—this persistent issue, specifically the **"DIDNT_OPEN_A_PORT"** error, is commonly due to Replit's internal port detection system rather than your server implementation.

### **Root Cause:**
Replit relies on automatic detection of a running server by listening for processes binding specifically to port **`process.env.PORT` (default: 3000 or 5000)**. Even when explicitly binding, certain conditions cause Replit to fail in detecting that port is open, particularly if:

- The server startup exceeds a timeout threshold.
- The server binds via non-standard methods or lower-level TCP sockets.
- There's intermittent latency or temporary outages in Replit’s infrastructure.

### **Immediate Workarounds:**

Given your experience, here’s the best practical approach:

1. **Explicitly Use Environment Variables**  
   Always bind explicitly to the port provided by Replit’s environment variable (`process.env.PORT`), as it’s dynamically set per Repl session:

   ```javascript
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
   app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
       console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

   Binding explicitly to `0.0.0.0` ensures your server is accessible externally.

2. **Manual Access**  
   Access your app directly via:
   ```
   https://<repl-name>.<username>.repl.co
   ```
   Replit maps external requests automatically to the open port specified by `process.env.PORT`.

3. **Alternative Deployment Platforms**  
   Since this issue might persist and affect development productivity, consider alternative cloud platforms like:
   - **Render**, **Fly.io**, **Railway**, or **Vercel** (particularly for Next.js).
   - Platforms with explicit, stable deployment configurations without automated port detection reliance.

### **Recommendation for Development Flow:**
- Continue your development workflow by directly accessing URLs instead of relying on automatic port detection.
- For critical applications, transition to a dedicated hosting platform that provides explicit and reliable networking support.

### **Official Support & Community:**
Consider reporting this issue directly to Replit’s support team, as they may provide platform-level interventions:
- [Replit Support](https://replit.com/support)
- [Replit Community Forum](https://ask.replit.com/)

Your decision to continue with direct URL access and consider alternative deployment environments is sound and practical.
